# Sales Price Prediction Web Application

This project aims to predict sales prices using various machine learning models and deploy them into a web application using Flask. The application allows users to upload sales price data, select a model for prediction, and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

1. *Data Collection*: We collected sales price data from Kaggle, focusing on a specific company's sales transactions.

2. *Data Preprocessing*: The collected data was preprocessed to handle missing values. We used interpolation to fill in missing values and ensure the dataset was ready for modeling.

3. *Model Application*: We applied eight different machine learning models to predict sales prices:
   - ARIMA
   - SARIMA
   - SVR
   - ETS (Exponential Smoothing State Space Model)
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
   - Prophet
   - ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
   - Hybrid
   
   Each model was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated based on performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

4. *Web Application Development*: We integrated the trained models into a web application using Flask, a Python web framework. Users can upload their sales price data, select a model for prediction, and visualize the results.

5. *Visualization*: We used Chart.js and D3.js to create interactive visualizations of the predicted sales prices. The application displays line charts showing the actual sales prices and the predicted values generated by the selected model.

## Project Structure

- *app.py*: The main Flask application file containing the routes and logic for data processing, model prediction, and visualization.
- *templates/*: This directory contains HTML templates for the web pages displayed to users, including the upload page and the prediction visualization page.
- *static/*: This directory contains static files such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files used for styling and interactivity.
- *data/*: This directory contains the sales price data used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- *models/*: This directory contains the trained machine learning models saved as pickle files.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Flask application using python app.py.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the web application.
4. Upload your sales price data, select a model, and view the predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Implement retraining functionality to allow users to update the models with new data.
- Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive user experience.
- Deploy the application to a production server for public access.

## Contributors

This project was developed by the following team members:

- *Mahum*: Mahum contributed to the training of four machine learning models and was responsible for designing and implementing half of the front end of the web application.

- *Duaa*: Duaa implemented four machine learning models and also contributed to designing and implementing half of the front end of the web application.

Both Mahum and Duaa collaborated on data preprocessing, model evaluation, and integration of the models into the Flask web application.
